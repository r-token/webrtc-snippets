<!-- 
    The HTML needed for a typical video element used with getUserMedia() will usually have the attributes autoplay and playsinline. The autoplay attribute will cause new streams assigned to the element to play automatically. The playsinline attribute allows video to play inline, instead of only in full screen, on certain mobile browsers. It is also recommended to use controls="false" for live streams, unless the user should be able to pause them.
